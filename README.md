# Analyzing changes of vegetation in Kruger Nationalpark due to impacts of the African Elephant

## Introduction
Welcome to the Kruger Git of the Internship at Kruger National Park's Scientific Services. Here, we present a collection of multiple approaches 
using different remote sensing products to analyse changes of the savanna vegetation in the national park due to the impact of the African Elephant (Loxodonta africana).
We proccessed and analysed drone data collected in August 2023 in specific small Elephant Impact Areas (EIAs) in the southern park around the Sabie river. Additionally,
we analyse a time series of MODIS vegetation indice products and of various land cover classifications. The aim is to find out whether we can confirm changes in vegetation, that 
have been recorded by game rangers in the field, with remote sensing data.

## Background
The impact of the African Elephant as an "environmental engineer" is a highly discussed topic in the Kruger National Park amongst many other. Whist elephants act to 
curb woody thickening and therefore structuring the physical environment with positive consequences for other fauna, they are feared to potentially decrease biodiversity
by debarking and knocking down specific tree species such as the Marula (Sclerocarya birrea) and Knobthorn (Acacia nigrescens) trees. Areas of high elephant impact are therefore
assumed to have a stronger trend towards an opening of savanna vegetation and a declie of large trees in comparison to areas of lower elephant impact.
